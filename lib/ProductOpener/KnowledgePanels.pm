=head1 FUNCTIONS


=head2 compute_knowledge_panels( $product_ref, $target_lc, $target_cc, $options_ref )

Compute all knowledge panels for a product, with strings (descriptions, recommendations etc.)
in a specific language, and return them in an array of panels.

=head3 Arguments

=head4 product reference $product_ref

Loaded from the MongoDB database, Storable files, or the OFF API.

=head4 language code $target_lc (or "data")

Returned panels contain both data and strings intended to be displayed to users.
This parameter sets the desired language for the user facing strings.

If $target_lc is equal to "data", no strings are returned.

=head4 country code $target_cc

Needed for some country specific panels like the Eco-Score.

=head4 options $options_ref

Defines how some panels should be computed (or not computed)

- skip_[attribute_id] : do not compute a specific attribute

=head3 Return values

Panels are returned in the "knowledge_panels_[$target_lc]" hash of the product reference
passed as input.
